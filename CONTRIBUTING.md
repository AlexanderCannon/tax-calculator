## Issues
If you want to make any non-trivial changes to the app please raise an issue so we can come to an agreement on a solution or improvement before any development work is done. 🛠

### Fixes

Feel free to report any bugs via issues, ideally with test cases and evidence. 🛰

 If you fix a bug and don't think it is necessary to raise an issue then just raise a pull request directly. 🛩

### Pull requests
Make sure your pull requests describe what your change is for and where possible provide evidence of improvements. Where necessary please add tests. ⏲

### Commit messages
🛡 Please use the [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines) for your commit messages.

### Tests

🏆 All changes should have comprehensive test coverage.

🥇 Before you commit ensure `yarn test` and `yarn lint` pass.

## Developing Locally

✅ Select the correct node version using
```
$ nvm use
```
💪 Or, if you don't have the specified version install and use with
```
$ nvm install 10.2.0

$ nvm use
```
🔧 Install
```
$ yarn
```
🎮 Then start
```
$ yarn start
```

🎁 See the scripts fields in `package.json` for all available scripts.

### Tests

🌡 Run the full suite with
```
$ yarn test
```

See [package.json](package.json) for test scripts. Please remember to check all tests are passing before you raise a pull request. 🆘

### Linting

I am using [eslint](https://eslint.org/) with the airbnb config. 🔬

See the [eslintrc](.eslintrc.js) for more details of our rules, and remember to check all your code conforms to the repository's standards before you raise a pull request. 🤖

🙌 Run the linting standalone with
```
$ yarn lint
```
#### Releasing

🤝 When cutting a release please increment the version number according to the [Sem Ver](https://semver.org/) standards.
1. 🍾 MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
2. ❄️ MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. 😎 PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

🔥 Run the release job with
```
$ yarn release
```


## Deploying

I will eventually add docker, watch this space! 👀
